If you are aware of interprocess communications, it will be easy to understand interthread communication. Interthread
communication is important when you develop an application where two or more threads exchange information.
There are simply three methods and a little trick which makes thread communication possible.

public void wait()
Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes notify().

public void notify()
Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.

public void notifyAll()
Wakes up all the threads that called wait() on the same object.

These methods have been implemented as final methods in object, so they are available in all classes. All
three methods can only be called from a synchronized context.
