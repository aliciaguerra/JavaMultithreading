Core Java provides a complete control over multithreaded program. You can also develop a multithreaded program
which can be suspended, resumed, or stopped completely based on requirements. There are various static methods
which you can use on thread objects to control their behavior.

public void suspend()
This method puts a thread in suspended state and can be resumed using the resume() method.

public void stop()
This method stops a thread completey.

public void resume()
This method resumes a thread which was suspended using suspend() method.

public void wait()
Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the notify().

public void notify()
Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.
